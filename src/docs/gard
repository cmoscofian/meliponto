USAGE: meliponto gard [OPTIONS] <start-date> [end-date]

DESCRIPTION: Punches gard entrances from the start date paramether up to the end date paramether (included), multiples punches done asynchronously therefore stdout output order may vary.

When wanting to punch a single day provide only the start-date paramether (for single day gard punch is always considered full day - NOT BEGIN NOR FINISH).

OPTIONS:
	--token     string  When provided will be used to authenticate instead of prompting for your password [OPTIONAL]
	--not-full	    If present will apply NOT full gard punches (do NOT apply BEGIN on first day and FINISH on last day) [OPTIONAL]
	--help              Displays the help message for the command
